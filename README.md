## Terraform Basics

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. Here's an overview of the key concepts:

1. **Providers**: Providers are plugins that interact with APIs of various cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP). They manage the lifecycle of resources.

2. **Resources**: Resources are the components managed by providers, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, or databases.

3. **Configuration Files**: These files, written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or JSON, define the desired state of your infrastructure.

4. **State**: Terraform maintains a state file to track the current state of the infrastructure. This allows it to make incremental changes rather than recreating resources.

5. **Modules**: Modules are reusable packages of Terraform configurations that can be shared and reused across projects.

6. **Execution Plan**: Terraform generates an execution plan that shows what actions will be taken to achieve the desired state. This plan must be approved before making any changes.

### Basic Commands

- `terraform init`: Initializes a Terraform configuration, downloading necessary plugins.
- `terraform plan`: Creates an execution plan showing what Terraform will do.
- `terraform apply`: Applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration.
- `terraform destroy`: Destroys the managed infrastructure.

By using Terraform, you can automate and manage your infrastructure efficiently, ensuring consistency and reliability.
